Project Description: A highly customisable tetris game implemented in Processing, with all proper features that are in actual Tetris, such as but not limited to proper rotation with wall kicks, scoring, keybindings, slow and hard drop, etc., with different gamemodes and things like block textures, as well as the ability for local multiplayer using different keybinds for each board, as well as additional features ("mods") that aren't in the Tetris base game as stretch goals.
